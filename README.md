# Arch-Briar
Arch-Briar is an expanded version of Briar â€” a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone who needs a secure, user-friendly, and resilient way to communicate. Development is ongoing to broaden its features and capabilities beyond the original Briar.

Unlike traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn't rely on a central server - messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices. 

If the Internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping information flowing in a crisis. If the Internet's up, Briar can sync via the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from surveillance.
